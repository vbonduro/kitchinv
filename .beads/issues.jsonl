Very low friction, no local tooling required. Best fit for this repo given the PR approval workflow — the release PR acts as a natural gate.\n- semantic-release: Fully automated, runs in CI, handles tagging + GitHub release + changelog. More config but more powerful. Skips the release PR step so less aligned with the manual approval process.\n- commitizen: Enforces conventional commit format at commit time via an interactive prompt. Usually paired with one of the above for the release side. Could replace free-form commit messages.\n- git-cliff: Lightweight Rust-based changelog generator. Easy to drop into a Makefile or CI step.

Photo preview: When the user selects a file and hits Analyse, the photo should appear in the photo block immediately. Currently createObjectURL is called after form submit but the image does not render reliably. The photo should appear as soon as the file is selected (onchange), not onsubmit.\n\n2. Analysis state not persisted across navigation: The streaming analysis runs entirely in frontend JS (fetch + ReadableStream). If the user navigates away mid-analysis and returns, the stream is dead and the page shows no indication that analysis was/is in progress. The server continues writing items to the DB, but the frontend loses all state.\n\nFix plan:\n- Move photo preview to the file input onchange handler so it shows immediately on selection, before the user even clicks Analyse.\n- For navigation resilience: on page load, check if there is a photo but zero items for this area (a signal that analysis may be in progress or recently completed). If so, poll or re-fetch the item list after a short delay. Alternatively, persist the in-progress state in sessionStorage keyed by areaID and resume showing the spinner + item list on re-load until items are confirmed present.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"vbonduro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T20:51:28Z","created_by":"Vincent Bonduro","updated_at":"2026-02-21T20:51:28Z"}
{"id":"kitchinv-6be","title":"Structured JSON prompt with error codes for vision response","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current vision prompt asks for plain-text pipe-delimited output (name | quantity | notes). This is fragile:\n- The model can drift from the format (prefixes like 'Here are the items:', numbered lists, etc.)\n- There is no way to distinguish 'no food found' from a parse failure\n- Partial failures (one item the model isn't sure about) are silently dropped or garbled\n- parse.go has ad-hoc heuristics to skip header lines\n\n## Goal\n\nChange AnalysisPrompt (internal/vision/vision.go) to request a JSON response with explicit status codes so parse errors and 'no items found' cases are surfaced cleanly.\n\n## Proposed response schema\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\" | \"no_items\" | \"not_food\" | \"unclear\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"string\",\n      \"quantity\": \"string or null\",\n      \"notes\": \"string or null\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStatus codes:\n- ok        – one or more items found; items array is populated\n- no_items  – image is a valid food storage area but nothing is visible/identifiable\n- not_food  – image does not appear to be a food storage area\n- unclear   – image is too blurry, dark, or otherwise unreadable\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. Update AnalysisPrompt in vision.go to request the JSON schema above\n2. Replace ParseResponse and ParseLine in parse.go with JSON-aware equivalents:\n   - ParseJSONResponse(raw string) ([]DetectedItem, string, error) returning items + status + parse error\n   - ParseJSONLine is not needed for the batch path; streaming still needs line-by-line accumulation (see below)\n3. Streaming consideration: the model will emit the JSON incrementally. Options:\n   a. Buffer the entire JSON response before emitting items (simplest, slight latency increase)\n   b. Stream individual item objects as soon as each complete array element closes (complex but fast)\n   Start with (a) — buffer full JSON, then parse and emit all items at once. Add a TODO for (b).\n4. Update AnalysisResult to include Status string field\n5. Update Analyze() callers (handler_upload.go / area_service.go) to check status and log/skip on non-ok\n6. Update all vision adapter unit tests and service tests\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- A 'not_food' or 'no_items' response results in zero items written to DB and a clear log message, not a parse error\n- An unparseable response is surfaced as an error, not silently swallowed\n- All existing unit tests pass with updated stubs\n- parse_test.go covers ok, no_items, not_food, unclear, and malformed JSON cases","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"vbonduro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T22:36:38Z","created_by":"Vincent Bonduro","updated_at":"2026-02-21T22:36:38Z"}
